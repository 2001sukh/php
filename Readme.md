## CHANGED PORTIONS IN LAB = 11-b

- Prefix Addition: Added a "/11-b/" prefix to all existing routes in the code.

- Uniform Application: This modification was uniformly applied to all types of routes, including GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE.

- Route Updates: As a result, each route, from basic pages like '/about' to more specific functions like '/notes/create', now starts with "/11-b/".

- Functionality and Controllers Unchanged: The core functionality and the controllers linked to these routes remain unchanged; the only aspect modified were the URL paths.
